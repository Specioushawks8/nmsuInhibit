1.1 Calendar & Scheduling Access <br> 

As an accountant with a full time job and children, I would like the ability to schedule my runs so that I can get in the habit of running daily. <br> 

Elaboration: Users should be able to schedule their tasks throughout their daily lives. We will have a calendar that they can sync with their life and work calendars to make scheduling easier. <br> 

Constraints: A constraint would be whether the user’s current calendar app can integrate data with our app without issues of legality or liability. <br. 

Effort Estimation: 4 person-hours. <br>

Acceptance Test: Perform syncing of Google Calendar & phone’s personal calendar to the app. After syncing is complete, schedule a task and ensure that scheduled task shows up on all synced calendars. <br>

<p> 
  During our research about the habit tracking app, we aimed at trying to understand who would be likely to use the app, what they expected out of the app, in terms of its features, functionality. Also, the goal was to understand what would motivate them to get the app, start and continue doing their habits.

It was easy finding people to interview as most people struggle with getting in a routine and would love to have an app that enables them to remember to do the activity, and helps them keep track of it. We interviewed Anekin Hetman, a track and cross country student athlete at NMSU. He struggled with keeping track of all
  the activities he had to do throughout the day and said he would greatly appreciate having something that would help him be able to keep track of his running, lifting and hydrating without too much struggle.

He has tried several ways to be able to track his daily activities and has to keep a physical log of his runs, how the runs felt, how long the runs were, and even things like hydration and recovery. This he says is always needed through the season by the coaches so they are able to monitor his progress as the season progresses
  and for his weekly meetings with the coaches. The idea that we were researching on developing a helpful app that would enable him to keep track of his day-to-day habits was interesting to him and he was willing to share his thoughts on what he as a potential user would expect out of the app.

For him, the most important aspects he would expect out of the app would be ease to use (in terms of ability to be able to add an activity to track. In this case running, lifting and hydration),
  ease of access to the activity so you can evaluate the progress you are making daily, weekly, or monthly. Also, a big thing for him was the ability to have notifications or reminders for things like hydration because some habits are easy to forget or monitor through the day if you do not have a reminder. He also thought that having an app that allows you 
  to delete an activity once you no longer need to keep track of it would be nice, or to be able to turn off the notifications when you do not need them. He also had an idea of being able to keep a streak of how long the user has been able to successfully accomplish a set task, i.e. running 6-7 days a week and if possible if the app could give a reward(Something like a badge) 
  or a challenge to its user. Another important functionality of the
  application was the ability to share the activity with other people. In this case, he was referring to the ability to share his progress of running lifting and recovery with his coach so that he would not have to keep a physical log to show to his coach every time they had a meeting.

From this user interview, we kind of understood a way of making the app more user friendly and make sure that the users’ got what they desired out of a habit tracking app.
