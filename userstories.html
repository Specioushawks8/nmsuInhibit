<p>I am a reward motivated young adult and I would like to get in the habit of doing the dishes before I go to bed. <br>

This positive reinforcement tool will aid those who are more reward motivated to continue performing tasks each day in<br>
the hopes of a *new* reward. <br>
<br>
<strong>Constraints: </strong> The constraints will be the storage capability of our app. We need to have enough reward tokens to be able<br>
to send back to the user but not so many that our performance is slowed by too much data stored. <br>
<br>
<strong>Effort Estimation: </strong> 15 Person-Hours <br>
<br>

more delectable reward is outputted.

more water throughout the day. <br>

medal/trophy in recognition of their achievements. Positive reinforcement has been shown to keep people motivated to <br>
continue a task. <br>

achievements. <br>

<h2> 3. Daily Progress Report </h2>
<h3> 3.1 Graphical Data </h3>
<p>
As a graphic designer, I love seeing data represented in interesting ways but have trouble finding the time to eat<br>
breakfast.<br>
<br>
<strong>Elaboration:</strong> Users should be able to track their progress in more than one way and a graphical display can give them<br>
better understanding of their daily progress.<br>
<br>

graph. <br>

<br>
<strong>Elaboration:</strong>A user should be able to track how well they’re doing on any individual habit, and see that data in an<br>
easy to digest manner such as graphs.<br>
<br>

accessible to show relevant data while also being secure enough that people’s information cannot leak.<br>
<br>

<h2> 4. Notification Systems </h2>
<h3> 4.1.	Reminders </h3>
<p>
As a busy student athlete, I would appreciate getting a quick reminder of an activity earlier enough so I do not<br>
forget or so that I am not late -<br>
i.e.  a reminder to drink water every half hour can be important on busy schedule times.<br>
<br>
<strong>Elaboration:</strong>Users should be able to receive a quick reminder or a notification of the activities that they are<br>
supposed to get done on time, say at a set interval of time or a specific time during the day.<br>

<strong>Constraints: </strong> our app should  make it easy to turn off reminders and notifications if a user does not need it anymore,<br>
or add on to reminders according to their needs<br>
