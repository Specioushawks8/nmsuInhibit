<p> &emsp; As shown above, our database is the repository. It contains four tables - user, habit, milestone and awards - <br>
    &emsp; within it that all interact with one another. Triggering events such as creation, deletion, editing of <br>
    &emsp; will update the repository in one of the four tables. All of the components underneath the repository <br>
    &emsp; work to maintain or change it in some way. The architecture is more stateful and reliant on knowledge <br>
    &emsp; sources than a traditional repository architecture. Each function returns an attribute's state, which <br>
    &emsp; updates all other components that needs the information via the repository being updated. All of the <br>
    &emsp; changes made to the repository via functions in the UI will also update and change the app's UI via <br>
    &emsp; the awards a user receives for completing milestones or graphs showing their progress. <br>
