<p> &emsp; As shown above, our database is the repository and all triggering events such as <br>
    &emsp; creation, deletion or editing of either user or habit will result in a change in the <br>
    &emsp; repository. All of the components that surround the repository work to maintain or change <br>
    &emsp; it in some way. The architecture is more stateful and reliant on knowledge sources than a <br>
    &emsp; traditional database. Each function returns an attribute's state, which is then stored in <br>
    &emsp; database. <br>
