<h1> Problem Statement </h1>

<p> Our habit tracker software will help users create and sustain healthier habits with daily reminders,
    positive reinforcement and intuitively recognizing when a goal has been achieved.
    This app seeks to be a compassionate tool that people can use to track their performance in regards to the formation
    of a long-term habit with smaller milestones along the way. The app will do this by allowing users to set times to
    accomplish the new habit, setting them up with a support chat group to help keep them motivated, provide feedback
    data for the user to see how they are doing, and provide positive reinforcement by giving achievement rewards
    for accomplishing milestones.  </p>
